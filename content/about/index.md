Hey there! I am **Hemant** AKA **Monty**. 👋🏼

Let's start with the very beginning I was born 🤱🏼 in **Bilaspur** (2nd capital of **Chhattisgarh**). As my father is a central government employee we had to live in different places. We were always surrounded by people from each direction of the country ⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️.

There is a beautiful thing about living in different places you get to learn about these magnificent cultures and traditions and I love it.

I've followed my studies at multiple Government schools 🎒 (KVs and state govt schools ).

I have pursued my Bachelor's in information technology 👨🏼‍💻.

As a child, I always liked to play with small electronic stuff. I was more of an indoor kid in the earlier days busy creating my own toys 🪀.

There was this bag where I used to put all my stuff. My mother called it **Garbage Bag** and always trying to get rid of it 😂 well that's the story of all of us, isn't it?

**After college,** **I took a drop for a few years to Prepare for the State Civil Services** and I was a teacher for a while.

**I really enjoyed teaching kids** but that's not it, after a long gap I decided to get back to my stream (IT).

I came to Bangalore and got an internship in a startup as a javascript developer.There I worked on some projects and took full responsibility for the FE development of an Edtech Project.
Then I worked for a Productivity and Engagement Management company, where I developed some cool features like employee Engagement Analytics, chart representation for goals and okr, etc.

Currently, I am in Bangalore.

That's it, Folks.

**Thank you very much for knowing me. I know we'll meet soon.** 👋🏼
