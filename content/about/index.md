Hey there! I am **Hemant** AKA **Monty**. 👋🏼

Let's start with the very beginning I was born 🤱🏼 in **Bilaspur** (2nd capital of **Chhattisgarh**). As my father is a central government employee we got to live in different places. We were always surrounded by people from each direction of the country ⬅️⬆️⬇️➡️.

There is a beautiful thing about living in different places you get to learn about these magnificent cultures and traditions and I love it.

I've followed my studies at multiple Government schools 🎒 (KVs and state govt schools ).

I have pursued my Bachelor's in information technology 👨🏼‍💻.

As a child, I always liked to play with small electronic stuff. I was more of an indoor kid in the earlier days busy creating my own toys 🪀.

There was this bag where I used to put all my stuff. My mother called it **Garbage Bag** and always trying to get rid of it 😂 well that's the story of all of us, isn't it?

**After college,** **I took a drop for a few years to Prepare for State Civil Service** but that didn't work out very well I end up being a Teacher.

**I really enjoyed teaching kids** but that's not it, after a long gap of 3 years I decided to get back to my stream (IT).

And I came to Bangalore, After a long gap It wasn't a cakewalk but after two months of working hard and failing interviews, I got an internship in a startup as a javascript developer.

one of my friends told me "Bangalore kisi ko nirash nahi karta"(Bangalore doesn't disappoint anyone), and he was told by another friend of his. I am telling you if you are someone who wanna start a Tech career it is one of the best places to be.

Current days I am in Bangalore **working with an Incredible EdTech company,** **learning, and sharing.**

That's it, Folks.

**Thank you very much for knowing me. Hope we will meet soon.** 👋🏼
